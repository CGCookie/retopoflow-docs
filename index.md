## Requirements

RetopoFlow v3.x requires Blender 2.83 or newer, and will work on any operating system Blender supports.


## Download and Install

You may download RetopoFlow from your [account dashboard](https://cgcookiemarkets.com/customer-dashboard/?task=download) on the Blender Market, assuming you've already purchased it. If you have not yet purchased a copy, then you may get it [here](https://cgcookiemarkets.com/all-products/retopoflow/).

The easiest way to install RetopoFlow is to do so directly from Blender. You can do this by going to **File > User Preferences > Add-ons > Install** from File. This will open a File Browser in Blender, allowing to you navigate to and select the .zip file you downloaded. Press Install from file.

*If your browser auto-extracted the downloaded .zip file then you will need to re-compress the **RetopoFlow** folder before installing.*

Once installed, Blender should automatically filter the addons list to show only RetopoFlow. You can then enable the add-on by clicking the checkbox on the upper right of the add-on panel.
