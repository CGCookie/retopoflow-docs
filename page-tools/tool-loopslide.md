The Loop Slide tool enables you to slide any continuous loop along the adjacent edges while keeping it snapped to the surface of the *Source object*.

Works in Edit Mode.

## Basic Usage
In Edit Mode on the *Target object* activate Loop Slide and then Left Click on the loop you wish to slide, move your mouse to adjust position, then Left Click again to confirm placement.


## Use Cases
The Loop Slide tool is used for adjusting existing geometry, such as for tightening up two loops to create a sharper bevel or crease.
