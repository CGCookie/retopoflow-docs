The Contours tool is designed to enable you to quickly retopologize cylinderical forms. Contours works by draw strokes perpendicular to the source object, along the form, which then creates edgeloops that're snapped to the surface. Strokes can be draw one after the other to extrude from one stroke to the next, or they can be drawn on separate areas of the source object to create multiple pieaces.

Works in both Object Mode and Edit Mode.
